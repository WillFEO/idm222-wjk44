        <h1>Difficulty Ratings</h1>
        <p>
          Understanding the challenge that lies ahead is a key part of preparing for any via ferrata. To help climbers select routes that match their abilities and comfort levels, various rating systems have been developed. One of the most common is the Austrian or "Schall" scale, which grades routes from A (easy) to F (extremely difficult), giving you a clear indication of what to expect in terms of terrain, exposure, and physical demand.

            </div>
            <h2>Easy</h2>
          </div>
          <p>These routes are perfect for beginners and families looking for a gentle introduction to the mountains. The terrain is mostly walking or simple scrambling, with steel cables and aids providing security on exposed sections rather than climbing assistance. A basic level of fitness and a head for heights are all that's required.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Moderate</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Routes rated 'B' introduce steeper terrain and may require you to use your arms for balance and progression. You'll encounter more frequent use of ladders and rungs on short, vertical sections. These are great for sure-footed beginners or those with some hiking experience.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Difficult</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Here, the climbing becomes more serious, with sustained steep and vertical sections that require good arm strength. You should be prepared for significant exposure and a physically demanding outing. 'C' rated routes are intended for climbers with prior via ferrata experience and a solid level of fitness.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Very Difficult</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Expect very steep, often vertical rock with some sections that may be slightly overhanging. These routes require significant arm strength and endurance, as there are often fewer rungs, forcing you to rely more on the cable and natural rock holds. These are for experienced via ferrata climbers in excellent physical condition.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Extremely Difficult</h2>
          </div>
          <p>These routes are a serious undertaking, featuring long, strenuous, and consistently overhanging sections. 'E' rated climbs demand advanced climbing technique, exceptional upper body strength, and a strong mind to handle the intense exposure. They should only be attempted by expert climbers with extensive via ferrata experience.</p>

            <h2>Exceedingly Difficult</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Reserved for the most elite athletes, 'F' routes push the absolute limit of via ferrata climbing. These are essentially protected sport climbing routes, almost entirely overhanging and requiring world-class strength and skill. For most climbers, these are routes to admire from below rather than attempt.</p>
