          I have always been an outdoorsy person. I was involved with Scouting for my entire childhood, from being a Tiger Scout as a first grader to becoming an Eagle Scout at 17. I love getting out into nature, be it through a simple day hike or a multi-day camping trip. Along with this love of the outdoors, I have also always been a thrill-seeker. I have been a regular of Six Flags Great Adventure for years now, and just a few months ago I tried skydiving for the first time.

      <section id="anecdote">
        <p>I found out about via ferratas when I was about 16, and I knew immediately that I needed to try one as soon as I could. For a couple of years, family vacations did not end up being near any via ferratas, but finally, just around my 19th birthday, we decided to go to Slovenia. Slovenia contains a large part of the Julian Alps, and I was not about to let that opportunity pass me up. I started researching and planning immediately, looking for the best possible options.</p>

        <div class="anecdote-section1">
          <img src="" alt="" class="anecdote-image">
          <p>I settled on two choices: one in the town of Mojstrana, and one that climbed Mangart, the fourth tallest mountain in the country. Mojstrana was an easily accessible and popular via ferrata destination, offering multiple routes ranging from A/B difficulty to C and even a stretch of D. As a beginner, I knew that it would be a great choice for me to try out a via ferrata for the first time. I started with the C/D route while I still had the energy, and then did the A/B route just for fun. I fell in love with it immediately; the just-right level of difficulty combined with the breathtaking views and exposure was my perfect combination.</p>

          <img src="" alt="" class="anecdote-image">
          <p>After Mojstrana, I was confident in my ability to take on Mangart, so a few days later I was standing at the base of the trail. As soon as I started, I knew that it was going to be an entirely different experience. While the trail was only rated at B level difficulty, it was significantly higher up and more exposed; it was common for me to look to my left or right and stare down a 1,000 foot drop. It was also much less consistently secured than Mojstrana; there were only cables to clip on to about 30% of the time, so I had to get comfortable with some unprotected scrambling.</p>

          <img src="" alt="" class="anecdote-image">
          <p>Even with that risk, I can honestly say that the Mangart via ferrata was the best hiking experience I’ve ever had. I have never felt as focused and at home in my body than I did climbing that mountain. It was a freeing experience to know that nothing else mattered in that moment besides my own hands and feet and the mountain in front of me. If you are comfortable with heights and physically able, I can’t recommend via ferratas enough. Renting gear is cheap and accessible, and most routes only take a few hours up and down. Get out there and give it a try!</p>
